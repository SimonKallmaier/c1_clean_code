# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
This project trains a classifier using data from kaggle.
The submission does not alter the data science behind the notebook,
but directly uses the code from there. It should be noted that sometimes
the code is updated to run more efficient.

## Running Files
There are three files.

- constants.py: saves commonly used constants.
- churn_library.py: implements the class which implements the training
and evaluation code.
- churn_script_logging_and_tests.py: implements the tests and logging.
This file is required to actually run and train the model. 

There is no requirements.txt, as this project only uses packages already
defined in the notebook.
